#### the blockchin trilemma

- decentralization
- security
- scalability

#### layers 2

they try to solve the trilemma by moving some of the computation off-chain and saving only the results on-chain. <br>

two main types of layer 2 solutions: <br>

- optimistic rollups
- validity rollups

#### optimistic rollups

a new state is considered valid by default, unless proven otherwise. <br
there is a 7 day challenge period, during which nodes can prove that the new state is invalid. <br>
ex.: <br>
`Optimism`

#### validity rollups

uses cryptographic proofs to prove that the new state is valid. <br>
